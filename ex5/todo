Basic Functionality:
+	- Display a welcome message and the range of input voltages
+	- Constantly update the current DC voltage applied to the ADC
+	- A hold button may be pressed to hold the current value
+	- Pressing the hold button again resumes measurement

Advanced Functionality:
+	- A second ADC connected to the PIC to measure a secondary DC / voltage differential
	- Pressing a mode button shows the maximum voltage applied
	- Pressing a sample button stores in memory
+	- An alarm feature should sound a buzzer if voltage falls below a threshold
	- The built in timer for the PIC should measure and display the time it spends below threshold
			Could add to the volt function

Separate functions required:
+	- Function for welcome message
+	- Function to measure calculate the DC voltage applied
	- Function to show the maximum voltage applied
	- Function to time and display the time spent below threshold

Pins taken (out of 13):
	- LCD		6 pins (Maybe 5)
	- ADC		3 pins (Maybe 2)
		second ADC would maybe require multiplexing and extra pin for button
	- Interrupt 2 pins	(RB0, RB7)	(Plus extra pin for third button)
		Hold button as RB0
			Holds the current value
			Pressing max button displays current voltage alongside max
			Pressing Sample button samples it
		Switch ADC button
			Toggles between ADC1, ADC2 and differential
		Need to connect a third button somewhere
	- Buzzer 	1 pin

For the hold button:
	Add a flag for whether held or not
	Toggle flag in interrupt
	If statement in main loop to check whether held or not
	Reset ADC flag on switching

Misc:
	Maybe make the buttons tri-state:
		Upon button press, add 1
		Modulo by 3, remainder will be eiter 0, 1 or 2

Immediate Jobs:
	Find out how much the welcome takes
	Test the interrupts
	Check if you need to reset cursor after clear
